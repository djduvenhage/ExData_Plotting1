Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project, Assignment Week 1:

	   This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", 
           available in coursera.

	   The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

	   The dataset being used is from the Human Activity Recognition database:  
                                (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


Files:

IMPORTANT: The code requires the user to set their own working directory in lines 5 & 9 of the code before running it.

	   CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
	    
           plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, & plot4.R contain the code to create the plots plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, & plot4.png.

	   The code can be copied into R or R-studio, the working directory entered into the code and run.
	
	   The output plots files are named plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, & plot4.png and can befound in the working directory 
	   under: "./Assignment1" after running the code.
	   
           A copy of the output plot files are uploaded in the course project form.
